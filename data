# Sales Objection Handlers Guide

## Common Objections & Responses

### 1. "We already have a knowledge management system"

**Response**:
"That's great! Many of our clients had existing systems too. The key difference is that traditional knowledge management requires exact keyword searches or browsing folders. Our AI-powered system understands natural language questions and retrieves information semantically.

For example, instead of searching 'pricing Q4 discount enterprise', you can ask 'What discount can we offer a large enterprise customer this quarter?' and get an instant, accurate answer with sources.

Most clients use us alongside their existing systems - we index their documents wherever they live (Notion, Google Drive, Confluence) and provide a much faster search layer on top."

**Success Story**: TechCorp kept their Notion workspace but added our system. Search time dropped from 5 minutes to 10 seconds.

### 2. "This sounds expensive"

**Response**:
"Let me help you think about the ROI. How many people on your [sales/support/team] spend time searching for information each day?

[Listen to their answer]

If you have 20 people spending just 30 minutes per day searching (conservative estimate), that's:
- 10 hours per day
- 50 hours per week
- 2,400 hours per year

At an average cost of $50/hour, you're spending $120,000 per year on people searching for information.
